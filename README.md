## About the app

Director Movie List is an app for movie lovers. The purpose of the app is to track what movies you have seen for a given director. You can add a director by typing the name of a director and it will then add that director to your list of favourite directors. You can then see all the movies the director has made and you can click on the poster of the movie to add it to your watched movies.

You can also get a recommendation on what movie you should see next, and it will get a random movie that you haven't yet seen.

Your watched movies and favourite directors is stored in localstorage, so that it persist over sessions.

## API used

I used the [TMDb (The Movie Database) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) to get the data for this app.
